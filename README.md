# leanwuzla
## Tactic Frontend
This provides the ability to call Bitwuzla with problems generated by the `bv_decide` tactic
frontend. You can call it like this:
```
bv_bitwuzla "/path/to/bitwuzla"
```
To point the tool towards the solver and if you want to see what bitwuzla is doing:
```
set_option diagnostics true
```
Alternatively to compare `bv_decide` and `bv_bitwuzla` directly run:
```
bv_compare "/path/to/bitwuzla"
```

## Terminal Frontend
This provides the ability to call `bv_decide` with QF_BV SMT-LIB v2 problems. You can call it like
this:
```
lake exe leanwuzla /path/to/file.smt2
```

## Quality and Stability
This tool:
- is a development tool for figuring out differences between what Bitwuzla and `bv_decide` can do.
- is not meant to be used productively
- does not necessarily produce a sound reduction to SMT-lib
