# leanwuzla
This provides the ability to call Bitwuzla with problems generated by the `bv_decide` tactic
frontend. You can call it like this:
```
bv_bitwuzla "/path/to/solver"
```
To point the tool towards the solver and if you want to see what bitwuzla is doing:
```
set_option diagnostics true
```

## Quality and Stability
This tool:
- is a development tool for figuring out differences between what Bitwuzla and `bv_decide` can do.
- is not meant to be used productively
- does not necessarily produce a sound reduction to SMT-lib
